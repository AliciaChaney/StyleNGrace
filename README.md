Project Outline


I. Project Description
The application will be a closet organizing application that allows you to store pictures of all items in your closet and will provide a separation list for each category in your closet including your shoes and accessories. It will also allow items to be marked as NEW (if a item) has yet to be worn. The app will come with the option of putting together “clothing boards”. This will be where you can create your “outfit of the day” prior to going into your physical closet to save time and energy. 

II. Problem addressing
Current closet apps focus on your wardrobe and what’s considered too much. You can’t make more than two weeks' worth of outfits no matter what combination you choose. You must keep editing your wardrobes to make sure have access to all items. Basically, it seems as though it has been a space issue. Knowing what you have in your wardrobe streamlines your life. With a capsule wardrobe, you will never feel as though you have 'nothing to wear’. It's reassuring to know what is in your closet, what you don’t need to buy (again), and what you can get rid of because you probably will never wear it. It's also great for the environment, as well as your wallet, to buy better and wear longer."


III. Platform
The application will be developed using the latest version of Android (Tiramisu). The 
application will be available for both Mobile devices and tablets. The application will be 
developed using Android studio.

IV. Front/Back End Support
The application will have full front and back-end support during the development 
process. Android studio will be utilized to test and debug before implementation begins.


V. Functionality
The application will allow for multiple categories to be added into your personal closet space. It will have a category specifically for clothing, shoes, and accessories. The category will have a space for you to upload a photo of the item (if you would like), the details of the item (color, size, name, if applicable), and any other details that will help you to visualize exactly what you have in your closet.  with each category having. 

VI. Design
